## Prachi Narnaware — Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for **Prachi Narnaware's data analytics portfolio website**, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases key projects, certifications, skills, and contact information in a modern, responsive single-page layout with supporting detail pages.

- **Skills overview**: Structured breakdown of programming languages, tools, and data concepts.
- **Contact section**: Direct links for email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

### Tech Stack
- **HTML5** for semantic structure (`index.html`, `projects.html`, `certifications.html`)
